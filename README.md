# Microservice-CurrencyConverter
This is the basic hello world project of microservices read here => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices 
Basically its a very loosely coupled architecture that can be shiped/remodeled/update/etc. at any point of developing without affecting other services.
this project is built on spring boot.
with eureka server that tells the status of all services. and loadbalancing and also api gateway 

Note: Since spring boot 2 the  netflix-ribbon and netflix-zuul are decrepted u can use Spring Cloud loadbalancer and spring gateway now.

u are free to change the server in my project.
